## Description

This application is a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. I built this timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and Bootstrap styling powered by my JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This timed quiz on coding fundamentals, that stores the user's scores, is for any coding bootcamp student to take so that they can gauge their progress compared to their peers.

### Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- [x] WHEN I click the start button THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- [x] WHEN I answer a question THEN I am presented with another question
- [x] WHEN I answer a question incorrectly THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- [x] WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 THEN the game is over
- [x] WHEN the game is over THEN I can save my initials and score

## Usage

The instructions are as follows:
> This quiz contains 15 questions and starts with 20 seconds on the timer.<br>For every question you get right, 5 seconds will be added to the timer.<br>For every question you get wrong, 5 seconds will be subtracted from the timer.

A correct selection is indicated with a green button, and a wrong selection is indicated with a red button. The quiz ends when the user runs out of either time or questions, whichever comes first. The user may then choose to take the quiz again, and the user may also save or clear their scores on the scores list.
